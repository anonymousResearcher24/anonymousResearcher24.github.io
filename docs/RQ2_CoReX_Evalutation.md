## Program Subjects: 
We borrowed the evaluation dataset from existing work [InPreSS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10172711), 
which includes 278 failures from six projects of the popular Defects4J benchmark and 8 large client-library project pairs with upgrade failures from LibRench.

The full list of subjects is available here:
